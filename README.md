# Shallow Search: Evaluating Deepseek R1 for Apache Error Log Analysis and Error Resolution

## Abstract

The objective of this study was to evaluate the performance of large language models (LLMs) in generating synthetic data for descriptions and solutions in Apache error logs while using reinforcement learning methodologies. Specifically, we examined DeepSeek R1, a reinforcement learning-enhanced model that is a distilled off of Groq’s LLaMA 70B. The study employed cosine similarity to assess the correctness of generated outputs against a labeled dataset and incorporated n-gram analysis to refine prompts. We observed significant model biases in sequential text processing and a dependency between severity misclassification and increased loss in description/solution generation. The results highlight limitations in distinguishing between similar error categories and the impact of overfitting in prompt design.

## Introduction

Large Language Models (LLMs) have demonstrated strong capabilities in understanding and generating natural language, but their performance varies significantly based on task-specific nuances. In system administration and software diagnostics, automated log interpretation is critical for debugging and anomaly detection. However, log entries can be highly ambiguous, requiring contextual understanding beyond simple pattern matching. This study investigates the application of DeepSeek R1, a reinforcement learning-trained LLM, to generate accurate explanations for Apache error logs.

DeepSeek R1 incorporates reinforcement learning to improve reasoning, making it an ideal candidate for structured tasks like log analysis. However, prior research on mathematical reasoning (DeepSeekMath) and compressed inference (LLMLingua) suggests that model efficiency and accuracy trade-offs may exist. Our approach focuses on evaluating how well DeepSeek R1 interprets logs by assessing its ability to identify error types, severity levels, and corresponding resolutions. By comparing DeepSeek R1 to a distilled variant of LLaMA 70B, we examine how different model architectures handle structured log data.

## Methodology



### Dataset description

The dataset, provided by Rootly, consists of Apache error logs labeled with five key features:

- Input: The raw Apache error log entry
- Error Type: Categorized as fatal, runtime, no_error, or warning
- Severity: Classified as notice, warn, or error
- Description: A natural language explanation of the issue
- Solution: A recommended resolution to the problem

To measure model performance, we used cosine similarity between model-generated outputs and ground-truth descriptions/solutions. Additionally, we analyzed n-grams (1-14) using NLTK to identify significant linguistic features, refining our prompts accordingly.

### Model Setup and Experimentation

DeepSeek R1 1.5B: Tested for reasoning capability and response coherence

Groq’s DeepSeek R1 Distilled (LLaMA 70B API): Compared for efficiency and accuracy

Prompt Optimization: Adjusted the order of text fields to leverage DeepSeek’s sequential processing behavior

Feature Engineering: Identified frequent misclassifications and adjusted prompts to minimize errors

Dimensionality Reduction Attempts: Explored LLMLingua compression and SVD-based encoding, but results were suboptimal

## Results and Discussion

Sequential Processing Bias: DeepSeek R1 interprets text in order of appearance, leading to prioritization of early fields. By placing the "solutions" field earlier in the prompt, accuracy improved.
Severity Misclassification Impact: Incorrect severity predictions correlated with increased loss in description/solution accuracy (~0.2-0.25).
Error Type Distinctions:
Poor differentiation between fatal and runtime, though this had minimal impact on descriptions/solutions.
SSL support unavailable classified as notice, aligning with dataset expectations and showing no adverse effect.
Done... misclassified as warn instead of notice, negatively impacting generated descriptions/solutions.
Persistent Model Errors:
Directory index forbidden by rule always misclassified, though impact on descriptions/solutions was inconsistent.
Child init [number 1] [number 2]... wrongly classified as an "error," leading to description/solution degradation.
Can't find child 29722 in scoreboard... consistently misclassified as warn instead of error, with no major impact.
Overfitting and Prompt Refinement:
The model overfit responses for specific patterns (e.g., Check the Apache configuration files had lower scores than Check the configuration of workerEnv).
If predicted=notice and actual=error, solutions were significantly degraded.
Injecting edge cases into prompts reduced logical inconsistencies in responses.
Performance Comparisons:
DeepSeek R1 1.5B: Average response time ~5s on an M3 Max chip (32GB RAM).
DeepSeek R1 Distilled (LLaMA 70B API): Average response time ~15s.
Smaller prompts led to better performance in DeepSeek R1 1.5B, indicating a need for more explicit guidance in reasoning tasks.
Dimensionality Reduction Failures:
LLMLingua and SVD-based encoding resulted in poor outputs, showing that compression techniques were ineffective for log analysis.
SpaCy-based embeddings were explored but found unnecessary given the structured nature of the dataset.

## Conclusion

This study highlights the challenges and advantages of using reinforcement learning-trained LLMs for structured log analysis. DeepSeek R1 demonstrated strong sequential reasoning but exhibited biases in error severity classification. Misclassified severity levels correlated with slight decreases in description/solution accuracy, and overfitting was prevalent in structured responses. While model refinements and prompt optimizations improved performance, certain persistent errors remained.

Future work should explore alternative reinforcement learning fine-tuning approaches and investigate hybrid models that incorporate structured parsing for enhanced interpretability. Additionally, integrating external validation sources could help mitigate dataset inconsistencies and improve generalization to real-world logging environments.
